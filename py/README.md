# Nix and Python

```bash
$ bash shell.sh
```
will run drop you into a `nix-shell` with `python3`, `numpy`, and `pandas`.

If everything goes according to plan this should go off without a hitch:
```bash
python hello_nix.py
```
Once you're done, <kbd>ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>d</kbd> or `$ exit` will set the world to rights.
